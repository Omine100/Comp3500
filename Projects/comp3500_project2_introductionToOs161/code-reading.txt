1. Which register number is used for the stack pointer (sp) in OS/161?
	- #define sp $29
2. What bus/busses does OS/161 support?
	- LAMEbus
3. What is the difference between splhigh and spl0?
	- splhigh() sets to highest value, all interrupts are disabled
	- spl0() sets to 0, all interrupts are enabled
4. Why do we use typedefs like u_int32_t instead of simply saying "int"?
	- So we really get a 32-bit unsigned integer
5. What does splx return?
	- It returns the old interrupt state
6. What is the highest interrupt level?
	- The highest interrupt level is #define SPL_HIGH 15
7. How frequently are hardclock interrupts generated?
	- Hardclock interrupts are generated 100 times a second
8. What functions comprise the standard interface to a VFS device?
	- The functions d_open, d_close, d_io, d_ioctl comprise the interface to a VFS device
9. How many characters are allowed in a volume name?
	- 32 characters are allowed in a volume name
10. How many direct blocks does an SFS file have?
	- An SFS file has 2 direct blocks
11. What is the standard interface to a file system (i.e., what functions must you implement to implement a new file system)?
	- To implement a new file system you must implement the functions fs_sync, fs_getvolanme, fs_getroot, fs_umount
12. What function puts a thread to sleep?
	- The function void thread_sleep(const void *addr); puts a thread to sleep
13. How large are OS/161 pids?
	- OS/161 pids are 32 bits or 4 bytes in size
14. What operations can you do on a vnode?
	- On a vnode you can open, close, reclaim, read, readlink, getdirentry, write, ioctl, stat, gettype, tryseek, fsync, mmap, truncate, namefile, create, symlink, mkdir, link, remove, rmdir, rename, lookup, lookparent
15. What is the maximum path length in OS/161?
	- The maximum path lenght is 1024
16. What is the system call number for a reboot?
	- #define SYS_reboot 8
17. Where is STDIN_FILENO defined?
	- It is defined with #define STDIN_FILENO 0
18. Is it OK to initialize the thread system before the scheduler? Why or why not?
	- Yes it is okay, the schedular creates the run queue and the thread system initializes the first thread
19. What is a zombie?
	- A zombie is a thread or process that has been exited but not deleted
20. How large is the initial run queue?
	- The initial run queue is 32 in length
21. What does a device name in OS/161 look like?
	- It is always "device:", for example "mrb0094:"
22. What does a raw device name in OS/161 look like?
	- A raw device simply adds a raw to the end of the device "deviceraw:"
23. What lock protects the vnode reference count?
	- vn_countlock lock protects the vnode reference count
24. What device types are currently supported?
	- Block and character devices are currently supported
